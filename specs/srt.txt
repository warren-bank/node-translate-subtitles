1. Introduction
===============
This document describes the SubRip file format.

2. Structural Overview
======================
A SubRip file is used to add or rip subtitles for a video. The file is a UTF-8 plain text file with a series of records of varying length. Each line inside the file is terminated with the control characters: Carriage Return (CR) and Line Feed (LF). All such files will usually contain an .srt file extension but are not restricted to this.

3. Structure
============
Contained inside the file is a series of records of the following format:
 ______________________________________
| subtitle number                      |
|--------------------------------------|
| start time --> end time              |
|--------------------------------------|
| subtitle text (one or more lines)    |
|--------------------------------------|
| blank line                           |
|______________________________________|


The record length will vary on the text specific information for the subtitle.

subtitle
- Monotomically increasing number starting from 1.

start time --> end time
- Each time reference will be in the format of hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds separated by the string " --> ".
  The two spaces at each end of the string are necessary for interoperability. Some programs will flag an error without the 
  spaces.

subtitle text
- The text you would like displayed on the screen giving the time interval specified in "start time" and "end time".
  This record can be multiple lines as long as the line immediately following these are the blank line.
  However, some applications will only use 2 lines for the subtitle text.

blank line
- Each record is separated by a blank line which only contains the CRLF control characters.

This record is repeated as needed.

4. Extensions
=============
There are extenions that are supported in some applications that allow the formatting of the "subtitle text".
One could use various html formatting tags in the following manner:
 ___________________________________________________
| <b>text</b>                     | bold text       |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <i>italics</i>                  | italicized text |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <font color="#ff00ff"> </font>  | text color      |
 ---------------------------------------------------
